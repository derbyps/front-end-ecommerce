# Portfolio E-Commerce

website : [Flower Shop](flower.derbyps.my.id)

This repository is created as part of an individual project during Alterra Academy Software Engineer bootcamp. I was asked to create an e-commerce, and this repository is the front-end half.

The idea of this e-commerce is to provide a platform to help seller sell their high quality products to customers. The technologies used in this project are the following:

- Front-End : React with Redux, HTML, CS
- Back-End: RESTful API with Python Flask
- Database: MySQL
- Deplyment: AWS
